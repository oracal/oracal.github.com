I work in a development team that is very heavily invested in ruby on rails for their webapps and that's where most of the teams experience lies with web development. But being a python guy I was quite keen to show everyone some Django development. So I used my latest project [repowatcher](http://www.repowatcher.com) as an example for some Django code, and hopefully get more people excited about Python and Django, plus it's always useful to see how abother language/framework does things differently.

Repowatcher is a site designed to easily track and organise repositories on github and bitbucket. I show some simple stuff in the presentation but the entire code base can be found [here](https://github.com/oracal/repowatcher).

I also had a go at using reveal.js for the first time to create my presentation. Anyway here is the presentation: [Django by Example](http://www.thomaswhitton.com/django-presentation).
