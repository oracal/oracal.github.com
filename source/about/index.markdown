My name is Thomas Whitton. I’m a 25 year old developer with a huge interest in software engineering and web development.

I created this blog to talk about some of the projects I’m working on and some of the problems I face on my path to becoming an experienced  programmer, hopefully helping others along the same journey.

I currently reside in the UK and work for BAE Systems Detica as a software developer.
